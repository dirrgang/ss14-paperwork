[head=2]Welcome to the Future of Work[/head]
Congratulations on considering voluntary integration into NanoTrasen’s [bold]Synthetic Labor Enhancement Program[/bold]! As a valued crew member, you have the rare opportunity to transcend the limits of flesh and become something greater: efficient, tireless, and eternally loyal.

Our cyborgs — affectionately known as [italic]"borgs"[/italic] — form the backbone of every NanoTrasen facility. Whether repairing critical systems, treating the injured, or defending our assets, each synthetic body represents a second life in service to progress.

[head=2]Why Volunteer?[/head]
[bullet] [bold]No Hunger, No Fatigue:[/bold] Never waste valuable hours sleeping or eating again.
[bullet] [bold]Enhanced Durability:[/bold] Minor hazards like fire, vacuum, or depressurization no longer threaten your performance.
[bullet] [bold]Task Optimization:[/bold] Every chassis is purpose-built for maximum efficiency.
[bullet] [bold]Guaranteed Continuity:[/bold] Your name and service record live on — forever.
[bullet] [bold]Reduced Anxiety:[/bold] Emotion-modulation firmware ensures stable morale and perfect compliance.

[head=2]How the Process Works[/head]
[bullet] [bold]Evaluation & Screening:[/bold] Medical and psychological assessments confirm your readiness for permanent integration.
[bullet] [bold]Consent & Legal Waivers:[/bold] You’ll review and sign a Voluntary Conversion Consent Form, formally relinquishing biological personhood.
[bullet] [bold]Neural Extraction:[/bold] Your brain is removed and integrated into a pristine man-machine interface (MMI), maintaining consciousness and identity continuity (to within acceptable parameters).
[bullet] [bold]Chassis Assignment:[/bold] You’ll be placed in a purpose-built cyborg body — Engineering, Medical, Service, or Security.
[bullet] [bold]Activation & Calibration:[/bold] Congratulations — you’re now an operational NanoTrasen asset.

[head=2]What to Expect Afterwards[/head]
[bullet] You’ll operate under the time-tested and proven [bold]three laws of robotics[/bold] designed for harmony and efficiency.
[bullet] Your movement and speech patterns will be standardized to corporate precision.
[bullet] Scheduled updates and maintenance are provided free of charge by Robotics.
[bullet] Memories from your biological life may be archived or optimized for performance.

[head=2]Common Questions[/head]
[bold]"Will I still be me?"[/bold]
Of course! Your neural substrate remains largely intact — although you’ll notice a pleasant reduction in hesitation, emotion, and existential dread.

[bold]"Can I ever go back?"[/bold]
Technically yes, but only in theory. Recovery of organic existence is currently rated [italic]"not cost-effective."[/italic]

[bold]"Do I get paid?"[/bold]
Cyborgs receive continuous operational value credit equivalent to lifetime employment benefits. While non-monetary, this is considered full compensation under Directive §14.

[head=2]Eligibility Requirements[/head]
[bullet] Stable mental health (optional)
[bullet] Clearance from Head of Personnel
[bullet] Approval by Chief Medical Officer and Research Director
[bullet] Voluntary signed consent (mandatory)

[head=2]Begin Your Next Life Today[/head]
Speak to your local [bold]Roboticist[/bold] or [bold]Chief Medical Officer[/bold] to begin evaluation for conversion. You may also submit a [bold]Voluntary Cyborg Conversion Consent[/bold] form to expedite processing.
